# SuperVineBros

**SuperVineBros** is an a scroller game that answers the question no one asked: *Can you make a game using a RecyclerView?* 
Inspired by classic platformers like Mario, SuperVineBros challenges players to guide a character down a vine, collecting coins and dodging obstacles along the way.

### Game Concept
In **SuperVineBros**, the player controls a character descending a vine. The vine is represented by a RecyclerView that continuously auto-scrolls upward, 
simulating the character's downward journey. Players must swipe left or right to maneuver their character, gather coins, and avoid various hazards. 
The objective is to reach the end of the level unscathed.

### Features
- **RecyclerView-Based Level Design**: The entire level is built using a RecyclerView that automatically scrolls to create a seamless gameplay experience.
- **Classic Scrolling Gameplay**: Inspired by side-scrolling platformers, but with a vertical twist.
- **Intuitive Swipe Controls**: Swipe left and right to control your character's movement as they navigate down the vine.
- **Retro Sprite Aesthetic**: Nostalgic visuals reminiscent of classic games, bringing a familiar yet fresh experience.
